# basic-code-quiz
So this is a small quiz i made trying to follow the mock up. It very difficult with no starter code 
but overall it was interesting. I researched a lot prior to starting so there might not be much yet
but i'm sure once our projects get even more complex i will get used to it. The app works this way:
you start the application by clicking start quiz at the opening screen, and then answer each question. 
At the end you will see your score that you can remember by adding a username. The functionality isn't 
great for now since I've been sick so it was difficult to work on this but I promise future projects will
be much better! C:
